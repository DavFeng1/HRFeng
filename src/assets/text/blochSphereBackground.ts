In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the state space of a system is given by a complex
Hilbert Space $(\\mathcal{H}, +, \\cdot, \\langle \\cdot | \\cdot \\rangle)$ .
For our purposes we can consider states in 
a quantum system to be vectors $|\\psi \\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}$.
The specification of "two-level" quantum systems means that we're working in dimension $2$. 
In this case we can consider $ \\mathcal{H} \\cong \\mathbb{C}$
