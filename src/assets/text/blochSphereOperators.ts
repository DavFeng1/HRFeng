Observables are represented as self-adjoint 
linear maps $ O: D_A \\subseteq \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{H}$.
We provide four operators, $\\{ \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z\\}$ are the Pauli operators
and $ H $ is the Hadamard operator. 
In quantum information, these are consider the atom building blocks for quantum logic gates.
