Observables are represented as self-adjoint 
linear maps $ O: D_O \\subseteq \\mathcal{H} \\to \\mathcal{H}$ where $D_O$ is the domain on which $O$ is defined.
We provide four operators, $\\{ \\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z\\}$ which are the Pauli operators
and $ H $, the Hadamard operator. 
In quantum information, these are the atomic building blocks for quantum logic gates.
